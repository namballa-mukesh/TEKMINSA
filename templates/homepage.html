					<h2>ABOUT Tekminsa</h2>
					<p>Tekminsa was created to support students. Many students especially freshers are confused with how to start their respective course. Many students are unable to find a official platform to discuss their doubts with professors/trainers. Even though colleges/universities appointed respective technical club team, but most of the students fail to interact with them. And to sort these problems, Tekminsa project was initialized.
