<h1>Tekminsa Professional Community Policies</h1>
<p>Tekminsa is a company that aims to put its members first when it comes to making important decisions. Millions of professional conversations and shared insights are being exchanged every day on Tekminsa's Services (defined in the User Agreement). To ensure these discussions help our members be more productive and successful, Tekminsa has put in place these Professional Community Policies outlining the activities that are acceptable on the Services, and what is inappropriate and may be stopped by Tekminsa. These rules are intended to provide guidance and restrictions governing your use of, and participation in, our Services.

1. Be Real. Unlike some other online services, our members need to be real people, who provide their real names and accurate information about themselves. It is not okay to provide misleading information about yourself or your qualifications, work experience, affiliations, or achievements on our Services.</p>
<p>2. Be Professional. We acknowledge the value of discussions around professional activities and ask our members to behave professionally by not being dishonest or inappropriate. When creating content on the Services, we ask that you follow our Publishing Platform Guidelines and keep your content professional, relevant, and on-topic. Do not share false information or use the Services to shock or intimidate others. And it is not okay to share graphic, obscene, or pornographic content on the Services.</p>
<p>3. Be Nice. We strive to maintain a safe and friendly community for our members. The Services shouldn't be used to harm others or their career or business prospects or to air personal grievances and disputes. It is not okay to use the Services to harass, abuse, or send other unwelcome communications to people (e.g., romantic advances, sexually explicit content, junk mail, spam, chain letters, phishing schemes). We do not allow hate speech acts like attacking people because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or medical or physical condition. Also, hate groups, terrorists, and those who engage in violent crimes are not welcome and not permitted on the Services.</p>
<h2> Respect Tekminsa's Rights</h2>
<p>Don't violate the rights of Tekminsa. You can find more information about what this means in our User Agreement. It is also not okay to suggest that you are affiliated with or endorsed by Tekminsa when you are not. Do not violate our intellectual property rights, scrape the Services, or interfere with or disrupt the Services.</p>
