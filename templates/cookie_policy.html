<h1>What is a cookie?</h1>
<p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Tekminsa features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Tekminsa and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Tekminsa and help us serve relevant ads to you.</p>
<h2>What are cookies used for?</h2>
<p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Tekminsa, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that’s in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Tekminsa faster and more secure.

<h3>What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</h3>
<p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Tekminsa does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.</p>
<h4>Controlling cookies</h4>
<p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>
